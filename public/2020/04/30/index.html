<p>Like the rest of you I was somewhat surprised by John Martinis&rsquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->abrupt resignation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from his position at Google. There&rsquo;d been rumors of some unrest at Google for a while now, but nothing concrete or unusual for any organization full of motivated individuals.</p>
<p>The Wired article I linked above, but extremely light on details, so I was happy to learn that Paul Smith-Goodson published a transcript of an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in-depth interview<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with Martinis on the subject of his recent departure.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t summarize the whole interview, it&rsquo;s short enough that I encourage you to read it for yourself. A few of Martinis&rsquo; statements underscore the difficulties of managing a highly experimental business such as this.</p>
<p><em>Autonomy and Control</em>
The problem with an undertaking like building a quantum computer is that, in the early stages, it inevitably requires a lot of PhDs figuring stuff out, laying groundwork for future standardization and reproducibility. PhD programs are made to mold bright young minds into competent, independent researchers. Google (and IBM, and Rigetti as well as the other QC hardware companies) can surely do just fine by replacing many of their PhD physicists with exceptional Physics B.S. and M.S. holders. The benefit of hiring a lot of PhDs, though, is that almost any PhD holder is guaranteed to be stubborn enough to finish a PhD and curious enough to become an expert on an incredibly niche topic that almost no one else gives a damn about. Selecting such people out of a much larger pool of B.S. and M.S. holders is more difficult than picking from a pool where these traits are more concentrated.</p>
<p>The usual PhD lifecycle finds new graduates striking out to a post-doc position, then, ideally, landing a tenure track position at a University and heading their own research group. You can imagine a similar trajectory of responsibility for graduates that take industry jobs, but with relatively less freedom in terms of research direction.</p>
<p>In quantum computing, a relatively small amount of employers are just vacuuming up newly minted PhDs as fast as they&rsquo;re being produced. In the case of Google, their feeder program IS Martinis&rsquo; UCSB lab, which means that upon graduation, those fresh new PhDs step out into the wide world of &hellip;. working for the same guy they&rsquo;ve always been working for, with the same people they&rsquo;ve been working with for the past 5-7 years. Is it any surprise that the folks with the longest tenure with John Martinis crave a larger degree of autonomy and responsibility?</p>
<p>One option could be for unhappy elements at Google to form their own company, a la Fairchild Semiconductor, and pursue an approach to quantum computing that better aligns with their vision. Of course, the difference between the environment of the late 50s for semiconductors and the present landscape of quantum computing is that there&rsquo;s no product. A spin-off company can&rsquo;t actually sell anything. Start-up costs are outrageously capital intensive, to even run any serious QC architecture will require millions of dollars invested in any of following: cryogenic systems, ultra-high vacuum systems, precision laser systems, chip fabrication (either semi- or superconducting).</p>
<p>Another option is to find a similar role one or two levels higher up the chain at a competing QC company. This also seems unlikely, since all QC efforts are about the same age, and are suffering from the same demographic glut of people in their late-20s and early-30s, who all really want to do one thing: build a quantum computer. The market for QC experts is hot, but it&rsquo;s not clear to me that there are very many open leadership positions.</p>
<p>The third option: effect change from inside. The anecdote about the theorist who started a parallel dilution refrigerator wiring effort suggests that Martinis had already lost Hartmut Neven&rsquo;s backing, so the writing must have been on the wall at least a year ago.</p>
<p><em>Is the hardware lead actually the hardware lead?</em>
If I were the new hardware lead at Google, that anecdote about the theorist would be immensely disturbing. Assuming there are no serious misrepresentations in Martinis&rsquo; characterization of events, it is absurd that the Quantum Hardware Lead at the time could not shutdown activities that he judged to be ineffective duplications of current work.</p>
<p>Absent any other incentives (the imminent quantum supremacy demo, for instance), I think a person with the reputation of John Martinis should&rsquo;ve resigned right there. The interview demonstrates he clearly appreciated the significance of that event, but had compelling reasons to stay.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point of being &lsquo;hardware lead&rsquo; if your manager, a man with scientific credentials, but no technical experience in this field, won&rsquo;t back your expert judgement?</p>
