<p>I was once asked to a review a paper on classical (digital) superconducting electronics. I’m not <em>really</em> an expert on that kind of thing, but I know enough to be dangerous.
After reading the paper I couldn’t detect any obvious flaws.
I didn’t have access to their data, so clearly I couldn’t check that they actually got the results they claimed, but I could check consistency between tables and figures, words and figures, and so on.
After a few read-throughs I felt I understood what the authors had done, and that it was likely correct. What I couldn’t fathom was why.
In particular, I thought they could have accomplished their goal with a much simpler (and faster) device.
Nor did I really understand how why the work was necessary at all.
Was this grounds enough for rejection?
My instinct was yes, but I had not really acted as an official reviewer before this point.
One of the side-effects of moving straight from academia to industry and switching fields at the same time is that you are not well known enough to be on anyone’s list.
I decided to consult with one of my much more experienced co-workers.
His advice, to paraphrase, was that the journal editor decides whether the work is interesting and I decide whether it’s bullshit.</p>
<p>I ended up suggesting that it be published with revisions, and that the authors should better develop the context and motivation for their work.</p>
<p>In the end the whole experience left me feeling uncertain about whether I’d done a good enough job and apprehensive about whether the process had been useful for the authors at all.
I’m not convinced that, had I been a true superconducting digital logic expert, I would have been able to better evaluate their work. At least not without access to the data and the analysis.
Of course, I wouldn’t have wanted to sink that much work into a review without gaining some tangible benefit from it!</p>
<p>The problems with peer-review, especially in the social sciences, have been belabored at length.
If you don’t believe me, just search for #peer-review on Twitter to get a taste.</p>
<p>At first glance, the problem seems less of an issue in physics.
We’ve been using the arXiv</p>
