<p>I was once asked to a review a paper on classical (digital) superconducting electronics. I&rsquo;m not <em>really</em> an expert on that kind of thing, but I know enough to be dangerous. After reading the paper I couldn&rsquo;t detect any obvious flaws. I didn&rsquo;t have access to their data, so clearly I couldn&rsquo;t check that they actually got the results they claimed, but I could check consistency between tables and figures, words and figures, and so on. After a few read-throughs I felt I understood what the authors had done, and that it was likely correct. What I couldn&rsquo;t fathom was why. In particular, I thought they could have accomplished their goal with a much simpler (and faster) device. Nor did I really understand how why the work was necessary at all.</p>
