<p>Australia&rsquo;s CSIRO recently published a roadmap for quantum technology titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Growing Australia&rsquo;s Quantum Technology Industry<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The report is pretty readable and highlights the major areas in which Australia has core competencies, both academic and private. Similarly, this article from the Nikkei Asian Review, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The subatomic age: Asia&rsquo;s Quantum Computing Arms Race<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does a decent job describing the state of play elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>The countries mentioned in the Nikkei article, Singapore, Japan, and China all have significant ongoing efforts in 2nd Wave quantum technologies. Indeed, Japan is expected to spend nearly $280 million on quantum computing in 2020 alone. In addition to this, nearly $1 billion is slated to be spent on a &lsquo;moonshot&rsquo; to build a 100 qubit quantum computer by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>By now you certainly are aware of China&rsquo;s prodigious expenditures in the quantum realm, both monetary terms and in infrastructure. Many major Chinese cities are establishing &lsquo;quantum technology&rsquo; centers or institutes.</p>
<p>Outline- Commonalities betwen Nikkei Article about asian quantum &lsquo;arms race&rsquo; and the Australian Roadmap</p>
<p>Interesting details in each</p>
<p>Strategic implications?</p>
<p>Creating and preserving process knowledge is as important as creating the technology itself</p>
<p>sensing undervalued?</p>
