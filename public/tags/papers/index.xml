      <description>I have a few opinions about the critical need for more focus on better materials and better fabrication techniques in the superconducting qubit community to help solve long-running issues with qubit coherence, qubit targeting, etc. So it was with some delight that I found this (pretty dope) paper published to the arXiv by the IBMQ team.
 Laser-annealing Josephson junctions for yielding scaled-up superconducting quantum processors.    Abstract  As superconducting quantum circuits scale to larger sizes, the problem of frequency crowding proves a formidable task.</description>
