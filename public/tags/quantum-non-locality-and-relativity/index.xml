      <description>Introduction The book opens with an introduction that teases us with some of the ideas that will be developed later on. We start with a statement of Bell’s theorem:
 …observable correlations between [entangled] particles could not be accounted for by any theory which attributes only locally defined physical states to them. The particles appear to be ‘connected’ or “in communication” no matter how distantly separated they may become. The outcome of experiments performed on one member of the pair appears to depend not just on that member’s own intrinsic physical state, but also on the result of the experiments carried out on its twin.</description>
