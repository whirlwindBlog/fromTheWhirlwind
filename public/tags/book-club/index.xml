      <description>This is the first of ?? posts cataloguing my read through of Tim Maudlin’s Quantum Non-Locality and Relativity: Metaphysical Intimations of Modern Physics.
Introduction The book opens with an introduction that teases us with some of the ideas that will be developed later on. We start with a statement of Bell’s theorem:
 …observable correlations between [entangled] particles could not be accounted for by any theory which attributes only locally defined physical states to them.</description>

      <description>Sometime between the end of grad school and now, I stopped reading fiction. My reading was almost exclusively science fiction/fantasy, and I&amp;rsquo;d get through at least 6 books a year, often much more. At some point, though, I stopped being excited by the genre. Or, at least, stopped being excited enough to spend time on works of unknown quality. I had been replacing some of that reading with non-fiction, mostly histories.</description>
