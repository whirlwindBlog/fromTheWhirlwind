      <description>I was once asked to a review a paper on classical (digital) superconducting electronics. I&amp;rsquo;m not really an expert on that kind of thing, but I know enough to be dangerous. After reading the paper I couldn&amp;rsquo;t detect any obvious flaws. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have access to their data, so clearly I couldn&amp;rsquo;t check that they actually got the results they claimed, but I could check consistency between tables and figures, words and figures, and so on.</description>
