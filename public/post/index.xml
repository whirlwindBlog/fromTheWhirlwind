      <description>Sometime between the end of grad school and now, I stopped reading fiction. My reading was almost exclusively science fiction/fantasy, and I&amp;rsquo;d get through at least 6 books a year, often much more. At some point, though, I stopped being excited by the genre. Or, at least, stopped being excited enough to spend time on works of unknown quality. I had been replacing some of that reading with non-fiction, mostly histories.</description>

      <title>Quantum Winter Insurance</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been thinking about the inevitable(?) onset of quantum winter. Maybe the frequent summer storms have bent the course of my thoughts toward turbulent ends, or maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just like this.
Quantum winter will hollow out our vibrant field, laying waste to start-ups and diverting talent and expertise to pursuits that will actually pay the bills. In many cases, deep process knowledge will be lost as practicing experimentalists are forced to change fields and major fab facilities direct their efforts toward the next thing.</description>

      <title>Building the Glorious Quantum Future</title>

      <description>UPDATE (06/22/2020): When I posted this originally I forget a small additional point I wanted to make regarding &amp;lsquo;full stack&amp;rsquo; quantum experiences on the cloud (Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Braket, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s cloud quantum, etc) and so have added in a mention about that at the end.
 Not too long ago, Marc Andreessen wrote an article titled IT&amp;rsquo;S TIME TO BUILD. Inspired in part by the inexcusably poor American government (federal, state, and local) response to the public health crisis brought on by the virus SARS-CoV-2 and its attendant disease, COVID-19, the piece decries the American drift away from building our way out of problems to a better future.</description>

      <description>I have returned from my absence at long last. Initially, my pen was stilled by the Darkness of the winter months. Each year the Darkness weighs more heavily upon my psyche than the year before, and this year was no different. I didn&#39;t have much to say during those months, but I did anticipate an earlier return than this. I expected March Meeting of the American Physical Society to be a promising trove of new ideas, both good and bad.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing vs Bitcoin</title>

      <description>Ever since Google&amp;rsquo;s quantum supremacy leak, my daily QC alerts feature at least one article about whether your Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc is suddenly in danger due to ~QuANtuM~. Mostly this has been amusing, and until now I have resisted clicking on the links to such articles, but eventually I caved. I, of course, immediately regretted doing so, but you know what they say, &amp;ldquo;What has been seen cannot be unseen.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing with Optical Traps</title>

      <description>It has been some time since my last post, but Quantum Computing is not standing still. This time I&amp;rsquo;m writing about a technology that is relatively obscure in QC, cold neutral atoms in optical traps. Why now? Well a new quantum startup has appeared focusing on exactly that: QuEra .
You&amp;rsquo;ll notice that the website is characteristically sparse, with little information about the team, aside from their names. We do know they&amp;rsquo;re hiring for a number of positions including &amp;ldquo;Special Effects coordinator and Mike Wahlberg stunt double&amp;rsquo; as of 11/30/2019.</description>

      <title>More Quantum Computing Deals: HQS and IonQ</title>

      <description>Activity in the quantum sphere continues with a seed roundconcluded for HQS Quantum Simulations. HQS claims to be &amp;ldquo;developing quantum algorithms to predict molecular properties for performance materials, specialty chemicals and pharmaceutical companies&amp;rdquo;.
IonQ closed a $55 million dollar funding roundto ostensibly to join their superconducting competitors in offering cloud-based access to their machines, and further improving control and programmability.
HQS It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to me that HQS claims their algorithms work on classical computers and quantum computers.</description>

      <title>The PhD Standard</title>

      <description>I came across this twitter threadin which a few physicists argue about what knowledge makes a Physics PhD.
Jon Dowling argues that some of the more advanced QM topics (WKB, specifically) are antiquated and not useful knowledge, now that we have the computational resources to solve these equations numerically to arbitrary precision. Rod van Meter chimes in with a slightly different take, that it should be possible to get a PhD in Quantum Computing without taking courses in Statistical Mechanics, and E&amp;amp;M, for example.</description>

      <description>Two new startups have joined the quantum world, Rahkoand Bleximo. They focus on quantum machine learning, and &amp;lsquo;practical&amp;rsquo; quantum computers for quantum simulation, respectively.
The big bet for Rahko and the rest of the wildly proliferating quantum software startups must be that some sort of useful, usable quantum computer is going to exist in the near term (&amp;lt; 5 years). If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, what they will be left with is a smattering of arXiv publications and some preliminary validation of their methods on whatever toy QCs IBM, Google, and Rigetti choose to provide for public use.</description>

      <description>Nature has published an articleinvestigating the VC funding landscape for quantum technologies.
It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, and the supplementary material provides a chronology of VC deals with quantum tech companies, with the deal size in dollars shown, if that information is disclosed. It&amp;rsquo;s a short read and I recommend it to get a sense of the scale of the effort, at least the privately funded side.
One particular portion stood out to me [bold is my emphasis]:</description>

      <title>What is the Value of Quantum Communications?</title>

      <description>Practicing physicists and interested observers by now have heard the many fantastical promises of the coming &#39;2nd Quantum Revolution&#39;. The usual hype is that quantum computers will smash mere classical encryption and usher in an era of unprecedented, colossal computing power. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to be said on that subject, but we mustn&amp;rsquo;t neglect the closely related quantum sensing and communications technologies that, together with quantum computing, fall under the umbrella of Quantum Information Sciences.</description>
