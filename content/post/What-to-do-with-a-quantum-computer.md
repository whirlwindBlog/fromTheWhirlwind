- Is NISQ work harming the progress of quantum computing?
- Proliferation of algorithms with no known use b/c the hardware is shit
- Proliferation of algorithms with no proof that they even offer quantum advantage, because the hardware is shit
- Should we be doing something else?


On the heels of the Google Quantum Supremacy leak, Nature has published a few interesting articles on quantum computing. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02936-3">This article</a> looks at where the hunt for useful quantum computers. It's an extremely sober look at the state of the field, contrasting the optimism of academic researchers/startup founders with the stark lack of results. Perhaps it is impolite to say that they lack results. VQE and VQF are certainly a result, if you're in the business of algorithms
