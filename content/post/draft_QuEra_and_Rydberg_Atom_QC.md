It has been some time since my last post, but Quantum Computing is not standing still. This time I'm writing about a technology that is relatively obscure in QC, cold neutral atoms in optical traps. Why now? Well a new quantum startup has appeared focusing on exactly that: <a href="https://www.quera-computing.com"> QuEra </a>.

You'll notice that the website is characteristically sparse, with little information about the team, aside from their names. We do know they're hiring for a number of positions including "Special Effects coordinator and Mike Wahlberg stunt double' as of 11/30/2019. At this point I can't tell whether someone misspelled Mark Wahlberg's name, or whether there some famous optical trap/cold atom physicist named Mike Wahlberg. Based on the state of the world in general, I think the probability of the latter scenario is low, but, shockingly, non-zero.

The best part of this start-up website is the <a href="https://www.quera-computing.com/technology"> Technology </a> page, which is basically a one-sentence description of the tech with 9 or so citations to either peer-reviewed publications or arXiv preprints. Dope.

The Qubits: `$^{87}Rb$`, the workhorse of the cold-atom world. Manufactured by Nature to be effectively indistinguishable, the prospective Quantum Information Scientist need not concern herself with fabrication variations of rubidium, she need only find a reliable Rb source.
