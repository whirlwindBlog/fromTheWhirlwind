Ever since Google's quantum supremacy leak, my daily QC alerts feature at least one article about whether your Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc is suddenly in danger due to _~*QuANtuM*~_. Mostly this has been amusing, and until now I have resisted clicking on the links to such articles, but eventually I caved. I, of course, immediately regretted doing so, but you know what they say, "What has been seen cannot be unseen."

The article in question is from __Decrypt__, titled <a href="https://decrypt.co/12593/counter-terrorism-expert-makes-scary-prediction-about-bitcoin">Counter-terrorism expert makes scary prediction about Bitcoin</a>. The counter-terrorism 'expert' in question is Andersen Cheng, CEO of Post-Quantum, and formerly head of TRL (a defense contractor). To be fair to Mr. Cheng, he is never quoted as describing himself as a counter-terrorism expert. The reader is left to infer this from the fact that TRL and Post-Quantum have either supplied counter-terrorism tech to the UK government, or worked for certain agencies with counter-terrorism focus.

The article goes on to make some claims:

>But Ryan and Allen are from the US, a nation Cheng said is lagging the rest of the world in its quantum computing industry. When US President Donald Trump put $1 billion in quantum research in late 2018, China spent $10 billion on a quantum research lab a year earlier

>Cheng is quick to clarify that those who estimate the quantum threat to be decades away make their assumptions based on what is known of commercially available quantum computers. Instead, Cheng speaks of the dangers posed by secret government projects, which can be purpose-built to solve a specific problem—like encryption—without concerns of commercial viability. “It can be the size of the football stadium, underground somewhere in the lab with all kinds of bandages around it. As long as it can start cracking encryption, who cares?
