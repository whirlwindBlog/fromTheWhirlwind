Ever since Google's quantum supremacy leak, my daily QC alerts feature at least one article about whether your Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc is suddenly in danger due to _~*QuANtuM*~_. Mostly this has been amusing, and until now I have resisted clicking on the links to such articles, but eventually I caved. I, of course, immediately regretted doing so, but you know what they say, "What has been seen cannot be unseen."

The article in question is from __Decrypt__, titled <a href="https://decrypt.co/12593/counter-terrorism-expert-makes-scary-prediction-about-bitcoin">Counter-terrorism expert makes scary prediction about Bitcoin</a>. The counter-terrorism 'expert' in question is Andersen Cheng, CEO of Post-Quantum, and formerly head of TRL (a defense contractor). To be fair to Mr. Cheng, he is never quoted as describing himself as a counter-terrorism expert. The reader is left to infer this from the fact that TRL and Post-Quantum have either supplied counter-terrorism tech to the UK government, or worked for certain agencies with counter-terrorism focus.
