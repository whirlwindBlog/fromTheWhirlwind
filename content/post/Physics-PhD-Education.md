This <a href="https://twitter.com/Liv_Lanes/status/1183882614245081088">twitter thread</a> in which a few physicists argue about what courses or knowledge make a Physics PhD.

Jon Dowling argues that a lot of the more advanced QM work (perturbation theory, for example) is antiquated and not useful knowledge, now that we have the computational resources to solve these equations numerically to arbitrary precision. Rod van Meter chimes in with a slightly different take, that it should be possible to get a PhD in Qunatum _Computing_ without taking courses in Statistical Mechanics, and E&M, for example. However, he would require a colossal amount of knowledge, mostly systems architecture stuff from what I can glean.

I confess to a strong emotional reaction when I went through this thread initially. It seemed insane to remove the eternal pillars of physics education from PhD requirements. Of course, then I remembered that my PhD courses were almost _totally irrelevant_ to my dissertation work. Jackson's E&M actually ruined electricity and magnetism for me. What had been a beautiful, elegant subject when presented by Griffiths (for undergrads, admittedly) turned into an ugly shitstorm of arcane vector calculus identities that obscured whatever intuition was expected to be gained from the problem sets. Stat Mech I mostly slept through, and classical mechanics is always a drag. Quantum mechanics was great, though. Unfortunately, spending an enormous time on scattering amplitudes does not exactly prepare one for a career in quantum information!

Even though my dissertation was on a topic considered to be 'quantum' (it has quantum in the name!), there was actually very little quantum mechanics at all. Part of this is because the microscopic theory of superfluid helium was and is, in my view, totally inadequate. Indeed, I would have been better served by a graduate fluid dynamics course, which was offered only in the Mechanical Engineering department.

The fact of the matter is that, pretty much in every PhD, the coursework is rarely immediately and directly applicable. Hell, I spent years in grad school without doing a single damn integral until I had to teach again during my final semesters.

Optimizing the PhD for 'usefulness' is a tricky thing.


- There's room for different approaches to QM: i.e. start from an information theoretic perspective

- a PhD should mean that you're prepared to do two things: 1. rapidly learn unfamiliar fields
2. contribute original work to those fields
