Activity in the quantum sphere continues this week with a <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/hqs-quantum-simulations-closes-2-6m-seed-financing-round/"> seed round</a> concluded for <a href="https://quantumsimulations.de/"> HQS Quantum Simulations</a>. HQS claims to be "developing quantum algorithms to predict molecular properties for performance materials, specialty chemicals and pharmaceutical companies".

<a href="https://ionq.com/>IonQ</a> closed a <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/ionq-secures-55m-in-funding-to-bring-quantum-computing-from-the-lab-to-the-enterprise/"> $55 million dollar funding round</a> to ostensibly to join their superconducting competitors in offering cloud-based access to their machines, and further improving control and programmability.


## HQS

- no specification of architecture, type of QC, etc
- is this just a way to turn VCs into defacto funding agencies for basic science work?
- The alternative is post-doc hell and maybe a tenure track position
- Would explain the proliferation of QC software startups



## IonQ

- 'Mature' tech, according to the standards of the fields
- Don't need to do any work on qubit development, b/c nature provides
- However, problem lies in system integration and Engineering
- building better traps, better control, optical systems, etc
- Currently outpace superconducting qubits on connectivity and sheer # of qubits available
- Can they keep up as qubit lithography becomes more mature?
- What kind of fab challenges do they face?
