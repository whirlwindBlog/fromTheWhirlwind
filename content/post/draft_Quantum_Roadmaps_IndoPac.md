Australia's CSIRO recently published a roadmap for quantum technology titled <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/Showcase/quantum/">Growing Australia's Quantum Technology Industry</a>. The report is pretty readable and highlights the major areas in which Australia has core competencies, both academic and private. Similarly, this article from the Nikkei Asian Review, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/The-subatomic-age-Asia-s-quantum-computing-arms-race2">The subatomic age: Asia's Quantum Computing Arms Race</a> does a decent job describing the state of play elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region.

The countries mentioned in the Nikkei article, Singapore, Japan, and China all have significant ongoing efforts in 2nd Wave quantum technologies. Indeed, Japan is expected to spend nearly $280 million on quantum computing in 2020 alone. In addition to this, nearly $1 billion is slated to be spent on a 'moonshot' to build a 100 qubit quantum computer by the end of the decade.

By now you certainly are aware of China's prodigious expenditures in the quantum realm, both monetary terms and in infrastructure. Many major Chinese cities are establishing 'quantum technology' centers or institutes.


Outline- Commonalities betwen Nikkei Article about asian quantum 'arms race' and the Australian Roadmap

Interesting details in each

Strategic implications?

Creating and preserving process knowledge is as important as creating the technology itself

sensing undervalued?
