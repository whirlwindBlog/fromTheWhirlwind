I have returned from my absence at long last. Initially, my pen was stilled by the Darkness of the winter months. Each year the Darkness weighs more heavily upon my psyche than the year before, and this year was no different. I didn't have much to say during those months, but I did anticipate an earlier return than this. I expected March Meeting of the American Physical Society to be a promising trove of new ideas, both good and bad. The meeting was (rightfully) cancelled due to spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the United States.

However, quantum computing work is thankfully not cancelled, and a 'recent' submission to the arXiv caught my eye. The paper is titled: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00024">New material platform for superconducting transmon qubits with coherence times exceeding 0.3 milliseconds</a>.

Here's an excerpt from the abstract:

<blockquote> Here, we fabricate two-dimensional transmon qubits that have both lifetimes and coherence times with dynamical decoupling exceeding 0.3 milliseconds by replacing niobium with tantalum in the device. We have observed increased lifetimes for seventeen devices, indicating that these material improvements are robust, paving the way for higher gate fidelities in multi-qubit processors.</blockquote>
