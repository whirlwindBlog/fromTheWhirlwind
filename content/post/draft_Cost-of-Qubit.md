If you've been exposed to experimental science for any length of time, probably you've gotten over your horror at the sheer cost of scientific equipment. Turbopumps routinely cost in excess of $10,000, particularly fancy lasers can come in at $100,000 or more. When money is tight, as it is in many academic labs, you are acutely aware of the cost.

Dil Fridge: $1 Million?
  - Includes pumps (>$20000)
  - Includes mix (~$150,000), expensive due to He-3
  - Doesn't include operation or maintenance. Cryocoolers are kW machines

Fabrication:
  - 10-100 k$? not sure here

Instrumentation Rack:
 - AWGs
 - Current bias Sources
 - Data acquisition
 - Superconducting cables



 Ion Traps:
  - High vac systems
  - lasers

Qubits per chip/trap: 10s (max 72 for gate model) thousands for DWave annealers)

Classical Bit Cost:

Can get a 2TB SSD for $300 right now. Comes to ~19 p$ per bit ($19e-12/bit).
