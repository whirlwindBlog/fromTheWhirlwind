<p>The (many) problems with peer</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The arXiv is good! It’s awesome to get access to important work in a relatively timely fashion, especially when the review process takes anywhere between months to years and exploits unpaid labor.</p></li>
<li><p>arXiv failure modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>basically no quality control</li>
<li>too many papers</li>
<li>no comment feature, can only respond through another pre-print</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>-SciRate tries to tackle 1 &amp; 3, but the overwhelming majority of papers receive no comment at all</p>
<ul>
<li>In the year 2020 papers don’t need to be pdfs, or not just pdfs</li>
<li>Envision each paper as a git repo with the pdf as just one part (that can be posted to arXiv)</li>
<li>Data analysis could be stand-alone Jupyter notebooks, data can be downloaded and manipulated by others</li>
<li>The most insidious issues are subtle mistakes in important papers, the solutions to which are not publishable, but still cost other researchers a lot of time and money to diagnose and fix.</li>
<li>Contributions in the form of fixes/comments/reviews, etc are considered <em>work</em>.</li>
<li>Good contributions in any form weighted at least as strongly as ‘publication’ in performance reviews</li>
<li>Non-publishable analysis tricks/techniques/etc disseminate more quickly.</li>
</ul>
