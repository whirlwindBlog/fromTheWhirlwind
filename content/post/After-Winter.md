-VCs and private industry (Google, IBM) are funding a lot of quantum computation efforts.

-Many, especially the software ventures, will inevitably fold when Quantum Winter arrives

- What happens to their research? The lessons they learn while trying to develop their 'products'?

- Presumably sold off as IP to some holding company?

- Is this going to have serious consequences down the line?

- If Google figures out error-correction or fault tolerant quantum computing, are they really going to publish their results?
